1,YTan_1,,,The Start- The First Dragon,Amelia Eldridge,"Feb. 6, 2020",My trip started with me feeling like a dragon spirit. I was hoping to meet a real Welsh fire breathing dragon!,Papercut on Rice Paper,"Y Ferwig, Wales and my dreams",,,,,,image/jpg,,,
2,YTan_2,,,Storm Ciara- Arriving Like a Dragon,Amelia Eldridge,"Feb. 7/8, 2020","It was said the worst storm in 100 years to hit the UK made land fall the day I got there. I mean literally the rain from the storm started just as I got to my hotel. There were many power outages, due to the wind some trainlines were actually down the entire month I was there. I often thought about if I had left even a day later-my trip would have been really different.  I really felt that I blew in like a dragon.

3,YTan_3,,,Meeting a Mermaid,Amelia Eldridge,"Feb. 9, 2020","The day after the storm, I was picked up in Carmarthen,which was where I was staying. The first thing we did when I got to Createspace was to go for a walk along the coastal cliffs. I had never experienced such intense rain and wind- I thought I was going to fly off the cliffs and the water was wild from the storm. So, when I got back to the residency I knew I had to make a stormy mermaid.",Papercut on Rice Paper,"Y Ferwig and Mwnt Beach, Wales",,,,,,image/jpg,,,
4,YTan_4,,,Rain to Waves,Amelia Eldridge,"Feb. 9, 2020","This image depicts the transtion from the dragon to the rain, clouds, and heavy winds that caused the crashing waves on the cliffs.",Papercut on Rice Paper,"Y Ferwig and Mwnt Beach, Wales",,,,,,image/jpg,,,
5,YTan_5,,,Meeting a Mermaid-Detail,Amelia Eldridge,"Feb. 9, 2020","Detail image of the mermaid meeting, while the scroll is hung from the rafters of the converted studio.",Papercut on Rice Paper,"Y Ferwig and Mwnt Beach, Wales",,,,,,image/jpg,,,
6,YTan_6,,,Y Gwynt- The Wind,Amelia Eldridge,Feb./March 2020,"The wind, which translates to 'y gwynt' in Welsh was my constant companion. The wind always had something to say- along with the dragons of course. Before leaving for Wales, I found and fell in love with a poem called Y Gwynt by the Welsh poet Dafydd Ap Gwilym. I hung both the Welsh and English version on my studio walls. I enjoyed thinking about dragons riding the wind.",Papercut on Rice Paper,"Y Ferwig, Wales",,,,,,image/jpg,,,
7,YTan_7,,,First Suspension,Amelia Eldridge,Feb. 2020,This was the first time I suspended the scroll piece from the studio rafters. I hung it with logwood silk dyed ribbons that I had brought. The studio light was particularly bright and beautiful that day.,"Papercut on Rice Paper, Light, and Air","Y Ferwig, Wales",,,,,,image/jpg,,,
8,YTan_8,,,Sleeping Baby Dragon,Amelia Eldridge,Feb./March 2020,I think this is my favorite dragon on the scroll. Sheep are absolutely everywhere in Wales. I happened to be there at the time the baby lambs were born. There was a working farm next to the residency. When I first got there the baby lambs were in the barn. But by the end of my time the lambs had come out with their mommas. They played and jumped in the field out back. It was such a joy to watch them. So of course I cut a baby dragon sleeping with lambs in the sun. ,Papercut on Rice Paper,"Y Ferwig, Wales",,,,,,image/jpg,,,
9,YTan_9,,,The Naiad of Rhaeadr Peiran,Amelia Eldridge,"Feb. 11, 2020",I took a tour of the Cambrian Mountains through a touring company called Cambrian Safaris. Richard the tour guide took me on a tour in his Land Rover. One of the places he took me was the Hafod Estate. He took me on a short walk to Rhaeadr (waterfall in Welsh) Peiran. I believe I met a naiad there. ,Papercut on Rice Paper,"Hafod Estate, Wales",,,,,,image/jpg,,,
10,YTan_10,,,A Naiad Bathing Under the Waterfall,Amelia Eldridge,"Feb. 11, 2020",The naiad I met bathes under the falling water of Rhaeadr Peiran. I dipped some moss I found along the walk in the water and kept it as a memorium of her energy.,"Papercut on Rice Paper, Black Tea Dyed Muslin","Hafod Estate, Wales",,,,,,image/jpg,,,
11,YTan_11,,,Black Tea Dyed Fabric,Amelia Eldridge,Feb. 2020,"I am backing the scroll with black tea dyed muslin. I ejoyed drinking tea in the studio, so it seemed extra fitting to back it with tea dyed fabric. I love the fawn color. ",Black Tea and Muslin,"Y Ferwig, Wales",,,,,,image/jpg,,,
12,YTan_12,,,Birds in the Back Country,Amelia Eldridge,Feb. 2020,Richard took me into the back country of the Cambrian Mountains. Red kites fly over small lakes. Birds by the sea in Mwnt.,"Papercut on Rice Paper, Black Tea Dyed Muslin","Ceredigion, Wales",,,,,,image/jpg,,,
13,YTan_13,,,Red Kites,Amelia Eldridge,"Feb. 11, 2020","Richard stopped at Bwlch Nant yr Arian Forest Vistitor Center, where we had a quick lunch. We then watched a feeding of Red Kites by the small lake. There were so many kites. It was after that we went on to the back roads of the Cambrian Mountains. Red kites are beautiful birds, with red feathers. They were almost completely wiped out by farmers who used poison to kill them, however their numbers are now back up due to a conservation program. One of my favorite cuts on the scroll.",Papercut on Rice Paper,"Aberystwyth, Wales",,,,,,image/jpg,,,
14,YTan_14,,,Final Scroll Suspension Shot Taken at Createspace,Amelia Eldridge,March 2020,This was the final hanging shot I took of the scroll at the residency. After this I rolled it right up and stuck it in my backpack/bag. Perfect for traveling-which was my intention for taking it to work on at the residency.,"Papercut on Rice Paper, Black Tea Dyed Muslin","Y Ferwig, Wales",,,,,,image/jpg,,,
15,YTan_15,,,Wise Old Wild Apple Tree of Bwlchystyllen,Amelia Eldridge,"Feb. 11, 2020","I met my one true love in the backcountry of the Cambrian Mountains. A wise old wild apple tree next to a ruined farm house, overlooking a small reservoir used for one of the old lead/silver mines. I could have laid down there and drifted away with the fair folk. We came upon it after leaving Gwaith Cwmsymlog mine. Gwaith Cwmsymlog translates to ""Valley of the Wild Strawberries.""

16,YTan_16,,,Tylwyth Teg,Amelia Eldridge,Feb./March 2020,"Tylwyth Teg, which corresponds to the fairy folk in Welsh, were my constant companions on my trip. They were always present. Particularly in the backcountry of the Cambrian Mountains.","Papercut on Rice Paper, Black Tea Dyed Muslin","Ceredigion, Wales",,,,,,image/jpg,,,
17,YTan_17,,,Dragon of the Eryri,Amelia Eldridge,"March 3, 2020","I went on a second tour with Richard, his Snowdonia Tour. I first contacted Richard to take me to Snowdonia. He then suggested his signature Cambrian Mountain tour as well. I read the story of Y Ddraig Goch, the red dragon of Wales, being buried in Dinas Emrys and I wanted to visit. It was where the famous battle between the red Welsh dragon and the White English Dragon took place. Y Ddraig Goch won! Snowdonia, or Eryri as it is called in Welsh, is the perfect place for dragons to play.","Papercut on Rice Paper, Black Tea Dyed Muslin","Snowdonia, Wales",,,,,,image/jpg,,,
18,YTan_18,,,The Lady of the Lake,Amelia Eldridge,"March 3, 2020","One of the places I asked Richard to take me to was Cwm Idwal. When facing away from Cwm Idwal, one looks upon Llyn Ogwen. Llyn (lake) Ogwen is one of the lakes in Wales where the Lady of the Lake is said to reside. It functions as a portal to pass through the mists to Avalon, a mythical otherworld in Arthurian legend. In King Arthurs last battle, the Battle of Camlann, his knight Sir Bedwyr throws Excalibur into the lake. The Lady of the Lake emerges from the lake, catches it, and takes it back to Avalon where she herself had had it forged.

19,YTan_19,,,Cardiff Castle,Amelia Eldridge,"March 6, 2020",The mountains of Snowdonia give way to Cardiff Castle. Cardiff being my final stop before heading back to the United States. The Keep of the castle has stood since Roman times. My last night in Cardiff I took an amazing ghost tour of Cardiff Castle with Dark Wales Tours. Really informative and not at all cheesy. The next morning I flew back to Maryland.I got back to the United States a mere few days before country borders closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.,"Papercut on Rice Paper, Black Tea Dyed Muslin","Cardiff, Wales",,,,,,image/jpg,,,
20,YTan_20,,,Y Gwyllgi ,Amelia Eldridge,"March 6, 2020","Throughout the tour, our guide told us different ghost stories associated with the castle, and experiences he had had while giving tours. At the end of the tour he told us one particular story where a previous tour attendee had said a huge black dog had been following them for their whole tour- which no one else had seen. At the end of the tour after the man disclosed that, their tour group heard a long loud growl. The security guard-who was not with the group-when later told about this event said he saw a huge black dog run across the grounds to The Keep earlier that night. A Gwyllgi is a huge black spectral dog. It is depicted here howling at the full moon that has risen over the Keep of Cardiff Castle.","Papercut on Rice Paper, Black Tea Dyed Muslin","Cardiff, Wales",,,,,,image/jpg,,,
