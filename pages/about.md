## About the Collection

This collection is made up of pictures of various papercuts that are part of a long rice paper scroll. The scroll tells the story of the artists' time spent in the wilds of Wales. The description with the image is the memory that inspired the papercut. The piece is called Y Tân which is Welsh for ‘the fire.’ The name is inspired by a Welsh folk song called Tân yn Llyn. It is a song about Welsh resistance to English rule. Since dragons are the theme for this scroll, and dragons have a special significance to Wales, ‘the fire’ is the perfect title.
